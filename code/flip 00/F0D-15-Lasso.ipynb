    "# Part I. Implementation of LassoRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "The LassoRegressor is a type of regressor that deal with the regression problem by solving the cost function:\n",
    "$$\\arg\\min_{\\boldsymbol{w}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D},b}\\frac{1}{2N}\\Vert\\boldsymbol{y}-(\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{w}-b\\boldsymbol{1})\\Vert^{2}+\\alpha\\Vert\\boldsymbol{w}\\Vert_{1},$$\n",
    " \n",
    "Where $\\alpha$ is a constant that will determine how much the **1-norm** term will influence the cost function, and the term $N$ is the number of samples that used to train the regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To lower the result of the cost function above, one frequently used method is **gradient descent**:\n",
    "$$x^{(t+1)}=x^{(t)}-\\eta g$$\n",
    "Where t is the t-th iteration, $\\eta$ is learning rate, or stepsize, and $g$ is the gradient. By solving this equation iteratively, we can reach a **local optimum point** with a proper **stepsize**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need to compute gradient, we have to apply **partial differentiation** to the cost function. However, one may found that is that the **1-norm** term might be **non-differentiable** at some points. This phenomenon will cause a big problem when we are training the regressor because that we want to use gradient descent method to train, but **we cannot obtain a gradient from a non-differentiable point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To cope with that annoying non-differentialble problem, I choose **subgradient method** as a method to tackle the problem."
   ]

    "### Subgradient Method\n",
    "The idea of subgradient method is simple :\n",
    "* When the point is differentialble, we just simply compute the gradient\n",
    "* If it's not differentiable, we randomly assign a value $[-1, 1]$ to it, as a **subgradient** and use it to do the descent task.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a **negative subgradient may to point to a descent direction.** Some constraint have to be imposed on it to make sure that our algorithm will descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I impose the following constraint to the subgradient:\n",
    "$$\\eta=\\frac{f(x_k) - f^{lev}_{k}}{\\Vert s_k\\Vert ^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\eta$ is a **modified** learning rate, $s_k$ is a subgradient, $f(x_k)$ is the cost function at iteration $k$, and $f^{lev}_{k}=\\min_{0\\leq i\\leq k}f(x_{i})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint can be simply interpreted as the description below:\n",
    "* If the regressor is converged to some point, the  $\\eta$ will be closed or equal to $0$.\n",
    "  - that is, when the regressor is closed to some local optimum points, it shouldn't take a big step size. This can prevent it from leaving the local optimum point since it has limited effect on the descent direction .\n",
    "* If the regressor is far from some points with low cost, the $\\eta$ will increase.\n",
    "  - that is, since you are not closed to any local optimum, you can take a big step.\n",
    "  \n",
    "By applying this constraint, we can make sure that the non-differential point won't drag the descent direction away from local optimum point, and thus the whole process will descent."

    "My XRegressor is still a lasso regressor. Or, more precisely, it's a lasso based regressor, with **Coordinate Descent** method and a pipepine designed for **data processing**. The core idea of  **Coordinate Descent** is simple:\n",
    "We perform line search procedure along **one coordinate direction at a time**, instead of computing the gradient of all weights at once. In each iteration, we will minimize the cost along one direction at a time. One benefit of this method is that since we only care about **one weight** at a time, so no partial differentiation needs to be calculated, and thus we don't need to worry about the subgradient problems that we encountered in part I. The update rules of my XRegressor is as follow:\n",
    "$$w_{j}=\\frac{S(\\sum^{N}_{i=1}x_{ij}(y_{i}-\\tilde{y_{i}}), \\alpha)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{ij}^2}, \\text{where}$$\n",
    "$$S(w,\\alpha)=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "sign(w)(|w| - \\alpha) & \\text{if w - $\\alpha$} > 0\\\\ \n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_j$ is the $j\\text{th}$ weights, $N$ is the number of training samples, $x_{ij}$ is the $j\\text{th}$ feature of $i\\text{th}$ sample, and $S$ is called  **soft thresholding**.\n",
