    "### Validation curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Every estimator has its advantages and drawbacks. Its generalization error can be decomposed in terms of bias, variance and noise. The <b>bias</b> of an estimator is its average error for different training sets. The <b>variance</b> of an estimator indicates how sensitive it is to varying training sets. Noise is a property of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following plot, we see a function $f(x) = cos (\\frac{3}{2} \\pi x)$ and some noisy samples from that function. We use three different estimators to fit the function: linear regression with polynomial features of degree 1, 4 and 15. We see that the first estimator can at best provide only a poor fit to the samples and the true function because it is too simple (high bias), the second estimator approximates it almost perfectly and the last estimator approximates the training data perfectly but does not fit the true function very well, i.e. it is very sensitive to varying training data (high variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and variance are inherent properties of estimators and we usually have to select learning algorithms and hyperparameters so that both bias and variance are as low as possible (see Bias-variance dilemma). Another way to reduce the variance of a model is to use more training data. However, you should only collect more training data if the true function is too complex to be approximated by an estimator with a lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simple one-dimensional problem that we have seen in the example it is easy to see whether the estimator suffers from bias or variance. However, in high-dimensional spaces, models can become very difficult to visualize. For this reason, it is often helpful to use the tools described below."
